# eink-daemon-node

eink-daemon-node is a tool for testing Waveshare e-ink panels.

Its goal is to facilitate the following:
<ul>
    <li>connecting to panels via USB or GPIO connection</li>
    <li>acting as a daemon through which other programs can interact with an e-ink panel</li>
    <li>provide a simple web interface for updating e-ink panels</li>
</ul>

This program is a work-in-progress and is not yet functional.
